## 🤝 **GitHub Workflow Questions**

### **Q: Will you automatically pick up my changes?**
**A**: Unfortunately, I cannot automatically pull from GitHub repos. Here's our best workflow:

### **Recommended Workflow:**
1. **You make changes locally** and push to GitHub
2. **Share specific changes** - Tell me what you changed or paste the diff
3. **I integrate changes** - I'll update my workspace with your changes
4. **Continue development** - I build on the latest state

### **Alternative Approach:**
1. **I can generate complete files** for you to replace locally
2. **You test and push** your versions
3. **Keep me updated** on what's working/broken
4. **Sync on major changes** before big development pushes

### **Best Practice:**
- **Before major changes**: Share your current state with me
- **After your changes**: Tell me what you modified
- **For complex features**: We can pair-program by sharing code back and forth

## 🎯 **Phase 3 Decision Point**

**Backend Hosting Options:**

### **Option 1: I Host Backend (Recommended)**
- ✅ **Faster setup** - I handle all backend deployment
- ✅ **Integrated development** - I can debug and iterate quickly
- ✅ **Less overhead for you** - Focus on testing and feedback
- 📡 **You get API endpoints** to integrate with frontend

### **Option 2: You Host Backend**
- ✅ **Full control** - You manage the infrastructure
- ✅ **Learning experience** - Hands-on with deployment
- ⚠️ **More setup time** - Environment config, hosting setup
- 🔄 **More coordination** - Back-and-forth for debugging

**What do you prefer for Phase 3?**
